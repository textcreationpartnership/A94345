            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115819:6"/>and worſhip of God here, the Churches, and government of Chriſt on earth; truly theſe are very glorious as they are in God, and God in them, ſo that they may well bee called the heavens, but even theſe as they come from God have their time and their end; theſe are the top and exceeding glory of all one wilderneſſe mercies, but all theſe are to be ſhaken, their end will ceaſe, and ſo muſt they too, theſe are as the pillars of cloude by day, and of fire by night, to the body of Chriſt whilſt it, or any member of it remaines in the Wilderneſſe, but Chriſt our head is aſcended whom will draw his whole body after him, and then the end of this will ceaſe, and their ſhaking time will be accompliſhed to the full, ſo that though this be the glory of the World, yet they cannot make up eſtabliſhment to eternall ſoules, becauſe they are to be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>Now by this I am further taught where to begin in ſeeking eſtabliſhment, namely, not in the whole Earth; no not in any part or appearance of Heaven that may be ſhaken, not in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or worſhip of God, but in God himſelfe: not in the Churches or government of Chriſt, but in Chriſt himſelfe. So that good King <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> counſell to his people in their day of ſtraights and ſhakings, will leade mee and all the people of God to a ſure center of eſtabliſhment: <hi>Beleeve in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall you be eſtabliſhed.</hi>

            <p>Theſe are the words of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> the King, to Judah and the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, at that time when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much feare, and doubts concerning their condition, by reaſon of a numerous and potent enemy which was come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; to an eye of fleſhly reaſon they were a loſt people and nation, but this good man had a better and more ſeeing eye to behold withall, namely the eye of faith; for in the 14, 15, 16, 17, verſes of this Chapter we ſhall finde that <hi>Jahaziel</hi> the Prophet, having the ſpirit of the Lord come upon him in the middeſt of the Congregation, when all the people were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together to ſeeke the Lord, did Prophecy and told the <hi>King, and all Judah, and the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, that they ſhould not bee afraid nor diſmayed by reaſon of the great a multitude which come againſt them, for the battell,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not yours, but Gods:</hi> He gives further direction when to goe downe againſt them, and what to doe; he tels them they ſhall not needs to

            <p>Now upon this was <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> eye of faith, he did beleeve in the Lord, and his word declared by his Prophet, and in this twentieth verſe, telleth the people where his eſtabliſhment was; namely, in God; and if they alſo ſhould beleeve in God as their God, and in his Word declared by his Prophet, that they ſhould thereby be eſtabliſhed; <hi>Beleeve in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall you be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My intentions are to take this Scripture in the largeſt ſenſe, and to make uſe of it in the carrying on a Treatiſe of Faith, as faith, and beliefe in God doth ſettle and eſtabliſh beleevers.</p>
            <p>The plaine and viſible truth which lyes in this Scripture, and upon which I ſhall carry on what followeth, is this; That Saints are eſtabliſhed, by beleeving in God, as their God.</p>
            <p>This is the ſenſe, and almoſt the very words of the Scripture; and for its proofe, it hath the concurrance of the ſcope, if not the letter of the whole Word of God, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his ſeaventh Chapter, and ninth verſe, prooves this by its contrary, when in the former verſes he had told them what God would doe for them, he telleth them in this verſe, <hi>If you will not beleeve ſurely yee ſhall not bee eſtabliſhed:</hi> As if hee had ſayd, it is not my bare narrative, or the hiſtory of God in his power, greatneſſe, and goodneſſe, that will eſtabliſh you, if you doe not beleeve; it is faith, truſt, and beliefe in God, as your God which is onely able to eſtabliſh you, if you beleeve not, your foundation will alwayes bee tottering, <hi>ſo that ſurely you will not bee eſtabliſhed;</hi> where beliefe is not, eſtabliſhment cannot be; the reaſon is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and plaine, for it is God alone that can and doth eſtabliſh the hearts of his people: now faith and beleeving in God, is the onely diſcovery of union with God, in which ſoules come to be eſtabliſhed, the ſoule by faith receiveth in God to it ſelfe, and involveth it ſelfe into God, and God in the ſoule makes it an eſtabliſhed ſoule: 2 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Chriſt dwels in the heart of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers by faith:</hi> This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> condition, who is called the Father of the faithfull; the Text ſaies,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.19, 20.</note> when God made him the promiſe of an heire out of his owne loyner, that he was not weake in faith, nor did he ſtagger at the promiſe through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, notwithſtanding his owne great age, and the deadneſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115819:7"/>of <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe, yet he beleeved the word and promiſe of the Lord and was eſtabliſhed; by beleeving this Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gave himſelfe up to God, he loſt his owne fleſhly reaſoning, in beleeving the faithfull word of God; God had ſaid, that he ſhould have a Childe of <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe, he giveth himſelfe over to God by beleeving, ſo that there is no ſtaggering, ſaith takes in the promiſe and the ſoule is eſtabliſhed, but where there is not faith to take in the promiſe of God, <hi>or rather God in the promiſe,</hi> there the ſoule is not nor cannot be eſtabliſhed; ſtaggering is as properly the fruit of unbeliefe, as ſtability is of faith; and they demonſtrate each other as white doth black, and black white; that Scripture which ſayeth, <hi>If you beleeve not you ſhall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed,</hi> doth give proofe to that Text which ſayes, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall you bee eſtabliſhed:</hi> So likewiſe on the contrary, our Saviour gives in ample proofe to this truth, that Saints are eſtabliſhed by beleeving in God as their God; in that <hi>John</hi> 6.47. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, hee that beleeveth in mee, hath everlaſting life.</hi> To beleeve in Chriſt, is to beleeve in God as our God, and the effects of this is eternall life, here is full eſtabliſhment indeed, here is life for ever; eternity cannot ſhake this beleeving ſoule, it is ſo eſtabliſhed by beleeving in God as its God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I intend to take this fundamentall eſtabliſhing truth into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; the which will give further light into what I aime at, and clearer teſtimony to the generall truth, That Saints are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by beleeving in God as their God; I meane an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, apropriating faith and beliefe in God.</p>
            <p>By beleeving in God, as our God, by which we come to bee eſtabliſhed, I meane this:</p>
            <p>Firſt, To beleeve in God in what he is in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To beleeve God in what he doth; namely in all his workes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To beleeve God in what hee ſaith, in his whole Word.</p>
            <p>And in all theſe ſo farre as God is communicable to beleeve him to be our God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beleeving</hi> thus in the Lord our God we ſhall certainely be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To believe in God in what he is in himſelfe. God in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115819:7"/>his Eſſence is incomprehenſible, and inexpreſſible; ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14.

And in this worke I ſhall take up Gods method, and firſt looke into the Attributes of God, for ſome diſcoveries of his Eſſence, wherein hee doth make knowne himſelfe to his people, that they may believe in him, in what he is in himſelfe; you muſt not expect I ſhould be ſo large in this as to expreſſe all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, that is a worke too large for a dying life, or a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, the fulneſſe of that will fill eternity; all that may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, which can be attributed to none but God, and that all is exceeding large, I ſhall onely mention ſome precious corner-ſtones, for believers to build upon, ſo that they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bee eſtabliſhed.</p>

<note place="margin">Iſa. 46.9.</note> and there is none like me.</hi> God in this Scripture ſpeaks poſitively; in the verſe before this, the people worſhipped and bowed downe to falſe Gods, to images of God; the Lord complaines of this in verſ. 5. <hi>To whom will yee liken me, and make me equall,
<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> and compare me, that we may be like.</hi> As if God had ſaid, you can liken me to nothing; for there is nothing like me, <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe (the true God)</hi> your falſe Gods cannot be like me. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 45.33.</note> 45.22. <hi>Looke unto me, and be yee ſaved all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none elſe.</hi> Marke the Scripture, ſalvation in in me, ſaith God, <hi>I am the God of ſalvation.</hi> If the ends of the Earth be ſaved, they muſt looke unto me, <hi>for I am God, and there is none elſe;</hi> That is, there is no other true God, no God that can

            <p>Againe, God is perfect, he is a perfect God, he is all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in himſelfe, and all that is perfect is from him, hee is that perfection to which there can be no addition, hee giveth life and breath to all things,

Perfection only lives in God: he giveth bounds to all things elſe, but can receive bounds from none: to the creature God ſaith, <hi>what have you that you have not received.</hi> But as for God himſelfe, he is ſimply and abſolutely perfect, ſimply purely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;

            <p>A third Attribute of God is his immutability;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Attribute. </seg>3</label> this is an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God, that he is an immutable, unchangeable God, for this can be ſaid of none but God; God hath made the whole
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115819:9"/>Creation mutable and changeable, which doth demonſtrate that himſelfe is only God,
<note place="margin">Num. 23.19.</note> who is unchangeable. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not a man, that he ſhould lye, neither the ſonne of man that he ſhould repent? Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not doe it? or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> What God ſaith, that he will doe, and what he hath ſpoken, he will make good; for he is an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God, hee is not like man to lye, or repent as the ſonnes of men: but he is God immutable, and unchangeable in all hee is, not one tittle ſhall faile of all that the Lord hath ſpoken: <hi>For I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. God makes this an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove himſelfe God, <hi>that he changeth not:</hi> As if hee had ſaid, there is change and alteration in all but my ſelfe, and I am the unchangeable God; <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, if I were changeable, I were not God: but being God, I am unchangeable. If mutability dwelt in me, I could not be the foundation and fulneſſe of all things both in Heaven and Earth:
<note place="margin">James 1.17.</note> but ſo I am, therefore I am the unchangeable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable God. This is fully proved in <hi>James</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and commeth downe from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning.</hi> This is a full deſcription of, and teſtimony to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable God, in him ſayes the Text, <hi>there is no variableneſſe nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> Not the leaſt ſhadow of change in God, the perfect God is an immutable God, and his immutability is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for he is God in both; there can be no change in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no imperfection in him: where there is change and mutability, there muſt be the annihilating of ſomething. Now it is impoſſible this ſhould be in God, for hee is an entire Eſſence, which can admit of no annihilating, therefore not any ſhadow of change. God is purely and ſimply what hee is, without all compounds; he is one moſt pure and intire Eſſence, nothing in him but God: God is a Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 4.24.</p>
            <p>A fourth Attribute of God is this;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Attribute. </seg>4</label> God is infinitely great in Majeſty and works, or the infinite greatneſſe of our God doth appeare in the greatneſſe of his Majeſtie and workes; God is ſo infinitely God,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 465.</note> that nothing can be like him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.5. <hi>To whom will yee liken me, and make me equall, and compare me, that we may bee like.</hi> As if God had ſaid, doe you creatures thinke you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing amongſt you that is infinite, that you goe about to

So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15, 16, 17. <hi>Behold, the Nations are as a drop of a bucket,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.15, 16, 17.</note> and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance. Lebanon and the beaſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are not ſufficient for a burnt-offering. All Nations before God are nothing, compared to him leſſe then nothing, and vanity.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the infiniteneſſe of God, that all beſides him cannot be compared to him, becauſe God is infinite, and ſo is none but God, and it is the infiniteneſſe of God that makes all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and compared to him, to be ſo empty a vanity. This infiniteneſſe of God doth further appeare in the greatneſſe and Majeſtie of his workes. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> had great experience of God in his great and glorious workings, and we ſhall ſee what ample teſtimony he gives to it, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 86.8.
<note place="margin">Pſalm 86.8.</note> 
               <hi>Among the Gods there is none like unto thee (O Lord) neither are there any workes like unto thy workes.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, there is no infinite God beſides thy ſelfe; and it appeares in thy workings, for there is no workes full of Majeſty and power like thine:
<note place="margin">Pſalm 135.5.</note> So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 135.5. <hi>For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Gods.</hi> The Prophet makes this an argument to ſtir them up to praiſe God: the declaring of his greatneſſe, <hi>hee is great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Gods:</hi> He is infinite in power and Majeſtie, and this makes him in his workes great above all Gods. The Prophet is in the ſame frame of ſpirit in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.3. <hi>Great is the Lord,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 145.3.</note> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be praiſed: &amp; his greatneſſe is unſearchable.</hi> Mark the Scripture, <hi>his greatneſſe is unſearchable:</hi> As if hee had ſaid, God is infinitely great, and none is infinite but God, ſo that his greatneſſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable; for finite creatures can never ſearch or finde out the infiniteneſſe of an it finite God. So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147.5.
<note place="margin">Pſalm 147.5.</note> 
               <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great power, and his underſtanding is infinite.</hi> God is infinitely great, he is ſo in power, in underſtanding, in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in all he is: that is, God is infinitely what he is, he is finite in nothing, nor can he be confined by any thing, becauſe Lee is the infinite God, of whom all things are; his infinite power gives bounds to all things, but can be bounded by nothing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24.
<note place="margin">Jer. 23.24.</note> 
               <hi>Can any hide himſelfe in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? Doe not I fill heaven and earth ſaith the Lord?</hi> God is infinitely great in knowledge as well as power; what can be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115819:10"/>hid from the al-ſeeing eye of an infinite God. Our God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely full, he filleth heaven and earth, he filleth all with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power and greatneſſe. The vaſtneſſe of Heaven and Earth can make no dimention to the infinite fulneſſe and greatneſſe of God: Heaven is his Throne, and the Earth his Foote-ſtoole, and all filled with the infinite fulneſſe of his power and greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Attribute. </seg>5</label> God is an eternall God.

            <p>God confirmes the former Scripture by this, that he is firſt and laſt; that is, he is eternall, hee is before all beings, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beings depends on him, ſo that nothing can be after him; If he ſhould ceaſe to be, there could be no beings, becauſe all have their beings from him, therefore God muſt needs be eternall, that is the firſt and preſerver of all beings:

            <p>As firſt, God is a God of free grace; we may call our God the gracious God, or the God of mercy and grace, wee may ſafely looke upon God thus, for God lookes upon us in his free grace; witneſſe his Covenant of free grace: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, God doth there ingage himſelfe to put <hi>his Law in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and to write it in the bearts of his people, that hee will be our God, and that wee ſhall be his people, that his people ſhall all know him from the leaſt to the greateſt of them;</hi> that he will <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all our iniquity, and remember our ſinne no more;</hi> God in this Covenant doth clearely ſpeake himſelfe to be a God of free grace, for the Covenant is all grace, it is pardoning and purging grace, juſtifying and ſanctifying grace, and as it is all grace, ſo it in all God; for God onely ingageth himſelfe, and this makes it to be all free grace: As God is gracious in his Covenant that it is a Covenant of free grace, ſo he is in his workes to his people; they are all workes of grace, and he is a God of free grace in all.</p>

            <p>Firſt, The great deſigne of God in his ſaving worke to his people, is to glorifie, or to manifeſt and declare the glory of his owne eternall, originall free-grace and rich love.</p>
            <p>The free-grace and rich love of God is God himſelfe, that God which is an incomprehenſible and inexpreſſible Eſſence, the true and perfect God, who is firſt without all cauſe of being, an immutable God, and of infinite great Majeſty; an Eternall, Omnipotent, and Almighty God: This is the God of Free-grace; now the deſigne of this God in the ſalvation of ſinners, which is the worſt and moſt miſerableſt piece of the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it ſelfe to all eternity, is to glorifie, or to manifeſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his owne free-grace.

Now in this verſe hee telleth us, if any be made veſſels of honour, and heires of glory, it is that God might <hi>make knowne the riches of his glory its his mercy and free-grace.</hi> As if the holy Ghoſt had ſaid, God accounts of his grace and mercy to be the riches and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his glory: Now to make it knowne that this is his great deſigne, God ſilleth heaven and earth with this his glory, the redeemed in Heaven, and the redeemed in Earth ſhall be one in Heaven at laſt, and therein ages to come, even to all eternity, be ſwallowed up into the exceeding riches and glory of his grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. And the holy Ghoſt in this, and the verſe before it, telleth us, that is Gods end and deſigne, <hi>in raiſing us up together, and making us to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus: That in the Ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſſe towards us through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If wee obſerve this Scripture, it holds forth this; that all the kindneſſe wee receive from God, it is his grace in Chriſt, and Gods deſigne in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115819:14"/>manifeſting of this his free-grace in Chriſt, is to ſhew forth the exceeding riches and glory of it; the whole worke of ſalvation will cleare up this truth; for if we conſider all the ſubjects of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we ſhall finde no object for any thing of God but his free grace and rich love, the pollution of faine man in his naturall condition could not be an object of preſervation to the holy, juſt, and pure eyes of an omnipotent God, nothing but free-grace and rich love in God could looke the lookes of life to ſouls dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes: And if thus, then it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that Gods great deſign in the ſalvation of ſinners is name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to glorifie, or to manifeſt the glory of his owne eternall rich love and free-grace. God will have ſoules live by his grace, that hee might manifeſt the life and glory of his grace; that grace which giveth life, appeares in the life it giveth, ſo that every ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſoule is a monument of the riches and glory of the love and grace of God, and the wiſe God layde his deſigne ſure when hee made choiſe of the ſalvation of ſinners, to manifeſt the glory of his free-grace by.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I ſhall hold forth how God doth accompliſh this great end and deſign of his: Namely, by making the whole frame and worke of ſalvation to flow from, and to depend upon his owne free-grace, ſo as there is nothing in the whole worke of ſalvation from firſt to laſt, but the free-grace of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5.8. <hi>Even when we were dead in ſinnes, bath quickened us together with Christ. (By grace are yee ſaved.)</hi> The time ſpeaks grace, when dead in ſinnes; this is a ſeaſon only for grace, and that the grace of God too, appearing, when not only in ſinne, but dead in ſin, paſt all recovery, as from ſelfe, if doing could prevaile; yet here is no life to doe withall; this is onely a time for a living love in God to act free-grace in: If ever ſalvation comes to ſoules dead in ſinne, it muſt be by grace, the grace of God ſaves of it ſelfe, without any cauſe out of it ſelfe, and this is the true ſalvation of ſoules dead in ſin, <hi>(by grace yee are ſaved)</hi> to be ſaved by grace, that is, to be ſaved in the ſalvation of God, the whole worke to be of his free-grace, not any tittle of it of our ſalves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God: Being juſtified freely by his grace.</hi> Marke it, there is all ſelfe under ſin: but ſaved, juſtified, and acquitted ſoules from ſin, are the fruits of Gods free-grace; though ſelfe come ſhort of the glory of God,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115819:15"/>yet free-grace makes perfection that juſtifies, this is the ſalvation of God, to juſtifie freely by his grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. <hi>That as ſinne hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reigne through righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto eternall life by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here ſinne and ſelfe hath its reign, but it is to death: but all the parts of ſalvation is the work of Gods free-grace: <hi>grace reignes through righteouſneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to ſaved ſoules, or Chriſt made righteouſneſs to ſuch ſouls, what is it but the reign of Gods free-grace; that is, grace is ſupreame, the grace is all in the whole worke of ſalvation; this truth will be made more cleare in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the parts of this great worke the ſalvation of GODS free-grace.</p>
            <p>But now conſider that God layes this worke, the ſalvation of his free-grace ſure, in the full ſatisfaction of his owne divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that ſo the ſaved of his grace might ſtand ſpotleſſe before him to all eternity.</p>
            <p>And herein is the miſtery of ſalvation, that Gods juſtice is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, and yet that his grace in ſaving his people ſhould be perfectly free: but both theſe doth plainly appeare in the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God to his people; the work of his free grace.</p>
            <p>Now the way of grace in God to ſatisfie Divine juſtice to the full, and yet to keepe it ſelfe entire free grace to all that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is this:</p>
            <p>Namely, to chuſe out, appoint, and to ſend Chriſt in the fleſh (God-man) to ſatisfie the Divine juſtice of God for man, in whom the wiſedome of God giveth full ſatisfaction to his owne Juſtice, and perfect ſalvation to his people all of free grace: In this glorious miſtery, free grace in God is the fountaine, full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Divine Juſtice the way, but perfect ſalvation and rdemption to all his elect body in Chriſt the end.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now come more particularly to the parts of this great worke of God, the ſalvation of his owne free grace.</p>
            <p>And firſt of Gods electing grace.</p>
            <p>That it is free grace in God which elects to ſalvation; that I ſhall firſt prove by the ſubjects of Gods ſalvation, which is fallen ſinners, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</hi> A lump of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, hath God to chooſe out as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for his love, veſſels of honour, and heirs of glory. If grace in God make not the choiſe, ſurely the whole lump of fallen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115819:15"/>ſinners would be left to remaine dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes: but the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 23. telleth us that God <hi>hath mercy on whom he will have mercy:</hi> That is, God is full of mercy: but he is free in it, his mercy lyes in his owne will, he chooſeth his own veſſels of mercy, <hi>That he might make knowne the riches of his owne glory.</hi> He chooſeth where he pleaſeth, that it might appeare he chooſeth according to his owne will and pleaſure; that is, that all his mercy and grace is free, and that the firſt worke, or part of the worke of ſalvation, his Election, is of and from his owne free grace: So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before him. Having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> That is, God chooſeth from all eternity, ſuch as he wil make his children, and heirs of glory by Chriſt, and this hee doth according to the good pleaſure of his own will: all fell alike in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> nothing in one more then in another to move God to love, for all were dead in ſinnes: but the whole work in God, is the worke of his grace, it is all begun and finiſhed <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of his</hi> owne <hi>will,</hi> all is the worke of his free grace.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, whom God thus chooſeth by his grace, he chooſeth in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as hee hath chooſen us in him</hi> (that is in Chriſt) ſo that all along grace is free in God, and the whole worke of ſalvation only of his free grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. What ever is in Chriſt is the gift of grace: ſo that Chriſt being the way by which God workes ſatisfaction to his own juſtice, and ſalvation to his people, it is all of grace; the reign of life in Saints by Chriſt, is the reigne of grace in God to Saints through Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Shall reigne in life by one Chriſt.</hi> God in Chriſt doth reigne over ſoules in righteouſneſſe, as the God of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is God in Chriſt, a God of free grace.</p>
            <p>But in the carrying on this worke of Gods grace, in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people through Chriſt, it is needfull that Chriſt take fleſh, according to that promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeede of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the Serpent.</hi> And this is accompliſhed in the fulneſſe of Gods time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>For unto us a childe is born, unto us a ſonne is given.</hi> The childe which is borne, is the ſonne which is given, Chriſt in the fleſh; the ſonne of God is the gift

            <p>Firſt, The Covenant of Gods free grace.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, The promulgation and ſpreading abroad of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods Covenant of free grace in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. In which God doth freely ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>To be our God, and that wee ſhall be his people, to put his Low in our inward parts, and write it in our hearts, that all his people ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt, and that hee will forgive their iniquity, and remember their ſinnes no more:</hi> In this Covenant God wraps up all the parts of the ſalvation of his free grace, and doth fully oblige himſelfe to them all: Now what is the reaſon that God doth thus oblige himſelfe by Covenant, is it becauſe of himſelfe, that he might not goe back from his deſigne of grace to his people?</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:115819:21"/>
            <p> No, he is God that changes not, an immutable God, <hi>Numb.</hi>

But God makes this Covenant for our ſake, that we might beleeve in him as a God of grace, and a faithfull God; the holy Ghoſt argues thus, he telleth us that a faithfull man will keepe his Covenant, <hi>much more God;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, The faithfull God hath made his Covenant of grace, that you might beleeve he will make good his Covenant, as he is a faithfull God; God obligeth his owne faithfulneſſe in a Covenant of grace, that his people might have both his grace and his faithfulneſſe for a foundation of their faith, God will be beleeved by his people, and therefore hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth himſelfe as a faithfull gracious God: to the faith of his people, ſayes God, I will pardon your ſinnes and remember them no more, I will put my Law in your hearts, the Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, and I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people; beleeve all this, for I will doe it ſaith God, I the faithfull, the gracious and omnipotent God; I that am omnipotent, who can hinder me, I that am gracious, ſo that your ſinnes can be no barre; nay, I that am faithfull and cannot lye nor repent, I have ſpoken it and I will make it good, what is the meaning of all this? but that we ſhould beleeve the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full word of our faithfull and gracious God; he will oblige his owne faithfulneſſe by way of Covenant, that wee might beleeve in the free ſalvation of his owne grace made out in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider what is Gods end in the promulgation, and ſpreading abroad of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>It is not that his people ſhould beleeve in the ſalvation of his owne grace, why is Chriſt pleaſed to be the way of Gods ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his people of his owne free grace, ſo that whom ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth thus on him, <hi>hath everlaſting life, John</hi> 6.47. But that they might beleeve and bee ſaved by him, 29. verſe, <hi>This is the worke of God that yee beleeve on him that hee hath ſent:</hi> This is the end of the Goſpell, for it is the effect of it, where it workes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, this is Gods worke, or the worke of his ſpirit in the Goſpell, to make ſoules beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt whom hee hath ſent; when Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, he directs them to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and biddeth them to Preach this,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.6, 7.</note> that <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven was at

                  </gap> the Sonne and beleeveth on him may have everlaſting life:</hi> It is not onely a bare hearing or ſeeing of Chriſt in the fleſh, but beleeving on him, that makes Chriſt to bee everlaſting life to the ſoule; and this is the end of God in the Goſpell, that ſoules might haw everlaſting life, through beleeving in Chriſt; it is faith in the ſoules of his people that God intends both by giving the Goſpel to the World, and preſerving it in the World: So that for theſe two reaſons, which might have bin exceedingly more inlarged, is doth appeare, That this is the will of God in keeping his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee wholy the worke of his grece; that the hand which received and applyeth it ſhould be a hand of faith, which is the worke of his owne free grace in the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I have held forth matter for faith in the ſoules of beleevers to reſt on for eſtabliſhment in the poynt of ſalvation, by ſhewing, in ſome of Gods Attributes what hee is in himſelfe, and what the deſigne of his free grace is, in the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>My intention is to hold out more matter for faith to take in, before I give the arguments for Faith, or motives to Faith.</p>
            <p>Now I finde this by my ſelfe, and others; that feares and doubtings in the ſoule, next to its owne ſalvation, is about the Church and people of God on earth, how it will fare with them, and therefore I ſhall in the next place take that into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

            <p>My anſwer is, To gather up matter for faith to live upon, to the eſtabliſhment of my owne ſoule and others, <hi>By beleeving in the Lord our God:</hi> And I truſt I ſhall not loſe my end; it appeares to me to be precious matter, for Faith to live upon God, and Chriſt, to the eſtabliſhment of ſoules: That the Church and people of God on Earth, are Gods intereſt and Chriſts intereſt, Gods Inheritance and Chriſts Kingdome, over whom he doth reigne in righteouſneſſe; his jewels, the purchaſe of his blood, and the throne of his glory; thoſe whom God hath choſen from all eternity to be the redeemed of his free grace, to unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome his love, and reveale his glory too, to all eternity; thoſe to whom he hath given Chriſt and in him all things, to whom God is a God in Covenant, and that of free grace, for whom God hath ſatisfied his owne juſtice through his grace in Chriſt, and made them compleate, even his owne righteouſneſſe in him; for whoſe ſake God reproves Kings, overthrowes unrighteous powers, daſhing them in pieces like a Potters veſſell with his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Rod, and amongſt whom Chriſt ſhall reigne King for ever, in peace and righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>This is to me abundant ground of faith, to believe in, and to caſt my precious eternal ſoul with al my comforts and concernments, upon Gods eternall love and free grace in Chriſt, ſalvation in all the parts of it to Gods Elect in Chriſt, is the fruits of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

            <p>To this I anſwer,

               </label> and acknowledge that Faith is the gift of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. But take this with it, this God is a God of free
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115819:32"/>grace, which giveth Salvation to his people, and the hand of faith to lay hold on his ſalvation, all in his owne grace; and therefore I tell my owne ſoule and others of beleeving in God, becauſe he is a God of free grace, I know faith is the worke of Divine power, it is not of our ſelves; therefore I ſay againe God is a God of free grace; ſtay not in ſelfe, lye at the throne of grace as that poore man in the Goſpell: <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe thou my unbeliefe:</hi> Me-thinkes he ſpeakes thus, Lord I beleeve that thou canſt helpe me againſt my unbeliefe; that thou canſt deſtroy the unbeliefe that is in me, and make me to beleeve upon thee, to eſtabliſhment; and I thinke this is the language of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſaith, Faith is the gift of God; is it not the ſame with this? Lord thou canſt make me beleeve in thee, it is thy worke to deſtroy my unbeliefe, and to helpe my ſoule againſt it.</p>
            <p>This is all I ſay, God is a God of free grace, and faith is the gift of his grace; he waites to be gracious to give his free grace and all the gifts of it freely to thoſe that need it, nothing in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but want, makes it an object for Gods grace; for he gives all freely without price, and without money: Now if faith be the gift of God, as thou doeſt acknowledge, then lye at the throne of his grace, if thou wanteſt, know all he hath is for thoſe that want; waite on him, and tell him he can helpe thee againſt thy unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>But you demand whether faith were not above the reach of humane reaſon and underſtanding?</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, Yes; when it is under its naturall darkneſſe; ſo that the ſoule it lives in nothing but nature as it fell from the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> So <hi>The naturall Man deſcernes not the things of God, neither can be, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> But when God comes to worke the worke of his grace in any ſoule, he doth not deſtroy his owne firſt and pure worke of nature in the man, the fall from grace corrupted the reaſon and underſtanding of man, as it did the whole man; ſo the reſtoration to grace doth reſtore the firſt image of God in the reaſon and underſtanding of men; though faith as it leads to God, and pitcheth the ſoule upon God, be above the light or reach of reaſon in it ſelfe, yet when God workes faith in the ſoule, and ſo takes the ſoule up to himſelfe, to live in him and to reſt on him, God doth not thereby
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115819:32"/>deſtroy reaſon and underſtanding in the man, that were to make him a Beaſt: No God doth inlighten and convince the ſoul in its reaſon and judgement, though when it was in its corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it could not diſcerne the things of God, nor underſtand the worke of his ſalvation of free grace in Chriſt through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, ſo as to chooſe God for a portion, and to reſt on the ſalvation of his free grace; yet when God ſhall inlighten the reaſon and judgement of a man by his owne ſpirit, ſo that now it is ſpirituall reaſon and judgement, then by the ſpirit of God in it, it comes to apprehend and to cloſe with the ſalvation of Gods free grace in Chriſt through beleeving; it is now reaſon and judgement ſanctified, and made light in the Lord: ſo that now it ſeeth a beauty in the grace of God, and Chriſt the gift of his grace; now it is no more its owne under its corruption, but Gods in his renuing grace, by which in Chriſt he hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, out of the power of Satan and the region of darkneſſe into his owne marvelous light, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t firſt it may onely fee men walke as trees, yet God will not leave it, till he makes it ſee plainely, <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as God commeth into the reaſon and judgements of his people, they have light in the Lord, the worke is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe but the more a worke of grace in God, that he doth thus ſanctifie and inlighten the reaſon and judgements of his people, carrying on the worke of his ſalvation in the ſoule; God is not bound to worke thus, for the whole worke of his ſalvation is free, but that hee chooſeth to worke thus, I thinke is the experience of all Saints that ever had reaſon and judgement, in which Saints have much joy, and by which doubtleſſe the glory of Gods free grace is much manifeſted and declared; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall in the next place hold forth ſome grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to the ſanctified reaſon and judgements of Saints why to beleeve in God, why to take his word, and to reſt upon the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his free grace.</p>
            <p>Grounds for faith from reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe there is truth in none but God and his Word; by God here I meane Father, Sonne, and Spirit; all truth is in this Fountaine, and what ever truth is in the creature, it is a ſtreame from this fountaine: ſo much of truth, ſo much a beama of God in any ſoule; It is one of Gods Attributes which we have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115819:33"/>mentioned to be a God of truth, which is the true God: I ſhall adde little to the proofe of it, only a Scripture or two, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.30. <hi>As for God,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 18.30.</note> his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tryed, be is a buckler to all thoſe that truſt in him.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, I have tryed God, by truſting him, and I find him true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all his words and wayes, his word is perfectly true; if her ſay he will be a buckler to you, you may truſt him, he is a tryed God of truth, he never deceived any foule that truſted in him, <hi>his truth reacheth to the clouds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm 57.10.</note> ſayes the Prophet, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57.10. It is boundleſſe truth, it is the truth of God, whom is all truth. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 117.2. <hi>The truth of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> That is, God is for ever a God of truth, hee is nothing but truth, not doth he ſpeake any thing but truth; not any ſoule can be decal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by believing what he ſayes, he meanes what hee ſayes, for he is the God of truth.</p>
            <p>Now I would argue with reaſon, and aske it whether it would chooſe <hi>truth</hi> or untruth to believe in: Doubtleſſe this will be the anſwer of a rationall man, I doe chooſe <hi>truth;</hi> for this it my miſery, I know not what to believe, there is ſo much untruth is the world, nor can I finde any man, or ſort of men to truſt, all men are ſo falſe: If mens words, promiſes, or engagements were any ſafety, wee have had enough of them: but men forget their words as winde, there is no truth in them, ſo that as a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature I am at a loſſe what to believe, of when to believe any thing that man ſhall ſay; <hi>Is it ſo Reaſon?</hi> Would you believe truth if you could find it? why then looke up to God, ponder his word; if you find any promiſe that anſwers your wants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, he will make all good that he hath ſaid, you dare not truſt men, becauſe they have ſo often deceived you; let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the argument backe upon you, therefore truſt God becauſe he never deceived you, nor any that ever truſted in him; take his word into thy armes of faith as fulfilled already, for not a tittle of all that he hath ſpoken ſhall fail; what God promiſeth to give his people, is as really theirs, as though they had it in poſſeſſion, and they may build upon it, he will not deceive them; nay he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, for he is God, and cannot <hi>lye;</hi> this is one argument to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the truth of God, becauſe it is an act of reaſon to put truſt in truth, and to chooſe truth to truſt in.</p>
            <p>A ſecond argument to reaſon, is the Almighty, omnipotent,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115819:33"/>and infinite power of God; and me thinks this ſhould be a ſtrong argument with reaſon, becauſe reaſon is ſo apt and prone to truſt in power: Darke and corrupted reaſon makes the powers of the world to be an argument againſt faith, when faith would have the ſoule truſt upon God, and to walke in the wayes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Why ſayes this ſinfull reaſon, all the powers of the earth will be againſt us, and come as a flood upon us and devoure us if we ſhould doe ſo. Well, if power bear ſo much ſway in reaſon, then to ſanctified reaſon it will be a good argument to beget truſt in God, to plead the power of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15. and ſo on,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.15. ſo on.</note> there you may read of the power of God, <hi>That it is ſo full and great, that all the Nations of the earth are but as the drop of a bucket, and the ſmall duſt of the ballance: all power compared to God is vanity, and leſſe then nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſanctified reaſon, here is power for thee to truſt in, that power which is all power, and commande all powers; that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which giveth forth all power, and can draw all into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe when hee pleaſeth; that power that doth in heaven and earth what ever pleaſeth him; <hi>That power with whom all things are poſſible,</hi> Matth. 19.26. It is not poſſible for thee to truſt in this power for any thing which is, or can be impoſſible to him: could corrupted reaſon but find a glimpſe of this amongſt men, it would adore it, and make a god of it; Oh then let ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified reaſon admire this God and reſt upon him, who is really that power <hi>with whom all things are poſſible.</hi> God hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, <hi>he can doe for us exceeding abundantly above all that we can aske or thinke,</hi> Epheſ. 3.20. What thinke you of this,

               <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> you thinke your thoughts are very vaſt, and that you can aske very much; yet in all this you are exceeding abundantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, what the Almighty, Omnipotent, and Infinite power of God can doe: We can want but as finite creatures, but hee can give as an infinite God; the fleſh we feare, is finite fleſh, the God we truſt is an infinite God. If power can ſinck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.4, 8, 9, 10.</note> 9, 10. He ſhewes what power God hath in his voyce, how full of Majeſty it is, <hi>That it ſhakes the Wilderneſſe;</hi> that is, the Whole world, and that he is King for ever. This is the King of glory, this is our God of power: Now here is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ſanctified reaſon to live upon, and it is the power of the God of truth, which will for ever be as truly power, as hee is truly God: ſo that if either truth or power may be arguments with Reaſon, here is both in God, which if believed on, will for ever prove powerfull truth, and truth in power, becauſe it is God in both.</p>
            <p>The third argument for faith which I ſhall offer to ſanctified Reaſon, is the eternity and immutability of God; That his truth is eternall truth, and his power is unchangeable and immutable power, you ſhall never finde him leſſe then God, and that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite all, more then can be conceived or expreſſed.

            <p>The Lyons were raging Lyons in themſelves, though their mouthes were ſtopped by God in the preſerving of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that put his truſt in him; O the power of God, fire cannot burne, nor Lyons bite where God forbids, he that made all for his own glory, can change the nature of what he hath made, when in ſo doing he may magnifie the glory of his grace and faithfulneſſe to his people; doth not theſe experiences ſay that God is onely to be truſted and feared; he ſhuts where no man opens, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens where no man ſhuts; <hi>Daniel</hi> had experience of Gods love and power in this; that thoſe very Lyons that lay like Lambes by him, ſhould devoure his enemies before his face; none can bound the holy one of Iſrael, but he can lock up the Lions mouths and open them at his pleaſure; ſure it is good to truſt in ſo good a gracious and powerfull God, one that giveth ſuch full experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his people that truſt in him of what he is; a God infinite in power, mercy, and goodneſſe; there is a ſpirituallity in all theſe experiences of God, which if God give in, in the reading it will make them exceeding ſweet, and apt to that end I quote them for; namely, to beget faith in God, and a holy dependency on him.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe holy witneſſes, let the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bring in his experiences of God, and we ſhall finde them to be very glorious; the Prophet doth at large declare how he came to be caſt into the Sea in a great tempeſt; here is nothing appeares to fleſhly reaſon but deſtruction, and doubtleſſe thoſe that caſt him out of the Ship expected nothing elſe, but that the Sea ſhould be a grave to his dead body, therefore they prayed that God would <hi>not lay his blood to their charge,</hi> in the 14. <hi>verſe:</hi>

            <p>For the next witneſſe to this, let us call in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that progreſſe of experiences which he had of God from his Cradle to his grave; I, from his birth we ſhall finde in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Booke of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that there was a Decree paſſed for his death before he had life, in that command that the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives had from <hi>Pharoah</hi> to murther every male Childe of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in the birth, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> was one, but God tyed up their hands and gave him favour in their ſight, that they obeyed not the command of <hi>Pharoah;</hi> there is his firſt experience of God, and when he could be hid no longer in his Mothers houſe, then God taught her as he did <hi>Noah,</hi> to make an Arke to preſerve her Sonne <hi>Moſes</hi> from drowning, and that Arke or Cradle of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes doth preſerve this precious Infant till God brings other hands to take care of him, in which worke of God there is much experience of his power, and wiſedome, that <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould preſerve tht a which her Father had appointed to dye, and that his Mother which brought him forth ſhould be the Pape which doth give him ſuck, this act of Gods providence brings double mercy with it, both to Mother and Babe, it joyes her heart to have her Childe in her armes; ſhee ſayes as <hi>Jacob,</hi> my ſonne <hi>Moſes</hi> yet lives; God had ſpeciall worke for him to doe, therefore he commits him to ſpeciall care in bringing him up, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the boſome of his tender Mother; truely theſe are very great experiences of God, yet he had more then theſe, God doth not leave him that he had thus preſerved, but takes care of him in his Mothers houſe, and in <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court, and when God comes to uſe him in that worke for which he had preſerved him, hee then findes God to be all in him; he went to the people of Iſrael up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods meſſage, and in the name of God to leade them out of Egypt into the Wilderneſſe to ſerve him, and as he went in Gods name, ſo all along he had great experiences of God.</p>
            <p>God made <hi>Moſes</hi> his meſſenger to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and in this alſo he had great experience of God, in his judgements upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> his houſhold and the whole Land, you may reade them at large; but when God had by <hi>Moſes</hi> brought the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt, then <hi>Pharoah</hi> in the hardneſſe and malice of his heart with a potent Army followeth them to the Red Sea, then the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115819:41"/>people murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> he goes to God and opens their condition before him, and comes backe to the people upon the experiences he had of God, and bids them from God, to <hi>ſtand ſtill and be quiet, they ſhould ſee his Salvation,</hi> and how full ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was, they all had experience of, it was wonderfull ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wrought in wonders, which doth upon experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare God to be a God of ſalvations, and a wonder-working God, a faithfull God; that made every tittle good which he had promiſed, they had full deliverance, and did ſee their enemies no more alive.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Moſes</hi> had exceeding full experience of God in his power and faithfulneſſe, that as God did imploy him, ſo he went along with him and made the Sea dry land for him and the people he led, to paſſe through death from death, into the Wilderneſſe, where God gave him and his company many and great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall joyne <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of Iſrael together in their experiences, and here they had a Pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night, in which they did experiment God to be a ſafe guide though in a Wilderneſſe, and an untrodden path, they thirſt, I, and murmure too for water, God by <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth them water from the Rook,

            <p>Like unto this was <hi>Gideons</hi> experience of God, when as with three hundred men he overthrew the whole hoſt of the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
<note place="margin">Judges 7.</note> Judges</hi> 7. We ſhall finde in this Chapter, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Gideon</hi> to leſſen his Army of two and thirty thouſand, to bring them to three hundred; God aſſures him victory with theſe few, and giveth him this reaſon why hee would have no more men, that the victory might appeare to be hie; <hi>Gideon</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes Gods will, and God makes good his word; <hi>Gideon</hi> did believe God could ſave as well by few, as by many, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory would be Gods, not mans: and God makes him to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment that of him which he did believe: <hi>Here is an experience of a full God amongſt empty creatures, when they engage againſt full creatures empty of God.</hi> God makes the victory his owne, and the ſlaughter of his enemies, for they kill one another; it is all one to God how weake ſoever the meanes be hee uſeth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Army be Flies, as in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or three hundred men, as here, the ſtrength is his owne, and that will certainly occom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh what it intends to doe, all theſe experiences doe plainly ſpeak it.</p>
            <p>So that widow in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. in that great increaſe of her cruſe of oyle, had ample experience of the fulneſſe of God, there is nothing too little for God to make enough; that is plain in this experience, this little oyle God makes it enough to pay all her debts, and anſwer all her wants; God is all himſelfe, therefore it is no ſtreight to him to make the leſſe to be enough, his own experience doth the worke, becauſe he is all in himſelfe; what God appoints to give out ſatisfaction to his people by, ſhall never ceaſe to give forth, till his people confeſſe they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: This fountaine of life giveth living ſtreames which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes flow and refreſh the City of God, this is God upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>

<note place="margin">Acts 16. lat. end.</note> in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>latt. end.</hi> where by an earth-quake God opened all the doores of the priſon, with the bonds that were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the priſoners; yea, and the hard heart of the Jaylor too, for he comes trembling now to enquire after ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: This Earth-quake God uſeth to ſhake the Jaylor and his Family out of their earthly condition into a heavenly; he and his Family were hereby taught to believe in God, then followeth the kinde uſage of the Apoſtles, and their deliverance out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; this affords great experience of the powerfull and glorious workings of God: God doth not onely ſhake the earth and the heavens alſo, but by ſhaking the earth, he ſhakes into heaven, he ſhakes the earth of unbeliefe out of this family, and filleth them with heaven through believing; doubtleſſe it is glorious power that ſhakes earth out of ſoules, and thoſe ſoules into heaven, this is the work of God upon experience.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now in ſome few particulars mention the experiences of Gods power and juſtice in his righteous judgements: I ſhall mind you of Gods judgements upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his hoſt in the red Sea: but no more then mention it, becauſe I have uſed that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture already.</p>

            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:115819:43"/>
            <p> We have another experience of God in his righteous judgement upon the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> being ſtrucke with blindneſſe in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when in the blindneſſe and wickedneſſe of their ſouls,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.11.</note> they would have abuſed the Angel of God that came to <hi>Lots</hi> houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the luſt of their owne hearts; the Scripture ſayes,

               <hi>there came all the men of the City, olde and young, and all the people from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter.</hi> A tumult of wretches full fraught with the ſinne of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and yet behold the experimented power of God, that preſerves his few faithfull ones from this multitude of <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and judgeth their firſt kindneſſe with a ſecond, ſo that they were weary in their purſuite after wickedneſſe. I ſhould be glad if this example might teach all blind wretches to be carefull how they meddle with the ſervants of the moſt high God, for hee is upon experience a God that revengeth the wrongs done or intended to his people.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Gods fearfull judgement upon <hi>Korah</hi> and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; you may read the ſtory in <hi>Numbers</hi> 16. and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. how the ground opened and ſwallowed them up alive, they lived in death, and were buried alive, they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and believed not God; theſe were dead ſouls in living bodies, and God throws in his diſpleaſure, their living bodies into the graves of death. Thus we ſee the Scripture is ful of proof in this, that God is an experimented God; theſe are the experiments that Saints of old have had of God, and left them upon record for the uſe of after ages: It is a great mercy that wee have theſe experiments of God, but I doe believe no age that ever lived were without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer experiences of God, I am ſure this preſent age is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wonderful, many, and great experiences of God in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, faithfulneſſe, power, mercy, and grace to his poore, hated, and deſpiſed people.</p>

God giveth to his children ſome more, and to ſome leſſe experiences of himſelfe: but in theſe latter dayes, God hath given ſuch great experience of himſelfe to the whole body of Saints, that I truſt he wil thereby eſtabliſh his people through believing in himſelfe as an experimented God; this is the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> drive at in my ſelfe and other Saints, and therefore have I made ſo large a recitall of theſe experiences of God to the ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of precious ſoules.</p>
            <p>And give me leave now to argue the caſe a little with ſanctified Reaſon, and to tell you that God is no new-found fancy or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, which may prove good or evill to the ſoule upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but God is the ancient of dayes from everlaſting, and a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, ſuch a one whom Saints in all ages have tryed and found to be a <hi>faithfull, gracious, juſt, righteous, glorious,</hi> and <hi>omnipotent God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tell me the beſt of reaſon, that which is moſt ſanctified; if God be not the beſt, nay the only foundation to build our ſaith upon: and if one ſo much experiment doth not captivate thy reaſon to himſelfe, I know it is a principle of right reaſon to truſt that moſt which hath been moſt tryed, and always found faithfull; therefore have I been the more large to hold out God to ſanctified reaſon as a faithfull God upon experience. Now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt either deny it ſelfe in its owne right principles, or elſe chooſe God as the only object of faith: If ſo, then I may ceaſe to argue, for I have my end: if otherwiſe it cannot be argued with as reaſon, for it ceaſes ſo to be, in denying its owne right and true principle.</p>
            <p>But if any ſoule full of ſanctified reaſon ſhall ſpeake like it ſelfe, and ſay, I will truſt my ſelfe where I find by experience; there is moſt grace, and goodneſſe; faithfulneſſe and righteouſneſſe, moſt power to preſerve me, and moſt fulneſſe to ſupply all my wants, then I ſay to ſuch a ſoule all this is God, and none of this is any where elſe but in God, and that God is an experimented God in all this; if thou kneweſt his dealings with thy own ſoule, thou wils confeſſe him to be ſo; his Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of olde have recorded
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115819:44"/>ſome of thoſe many and great experiences which they had of him. Now here is that thou lookeſt for, experimented goodneſſe and faithfulneſſe in God, and that which God lookes for, is that: Now thou ſhouldſt truſt him upon all that experience which thy owne ſoule, and other of his Saints have had of him: If thou haſt any thing to object, make thy objection, there is fulneſſe enough in God to anſwer all that thou canſt deſire; if all be anſwered, then truſt him that is all, and doth ſatisfie all that truſt in him with his owne fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>The fifth argument that I ſhall offer to ſanctified Reaſon why to believe in God, is this; That God counts his faithfulneſſe his glory, and was never ſtained in it, nor can ever be, becauſe he is the faithfull God, a God that never failed any that truſted in him: ſo ſayes the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.30.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.30.</note> 
               <hi>As for God his way is perfect, his word is tryed, bee is a buckler to all thoſe that truſt in him.</hi> God is perfectly faithfull in all his words, his workes, and his wayes; hee cannot deny himſelfe to be God, therefore can never be unfaithfull. From hence the Pſalmiſt in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33.21.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.21.</note> ſaith, that <hi>the righteous doe reigne in the Lord, when he makes them to truſt in him.</hi> For they then joy in their deſires as fulfilled; for if God make them truſt in him for it, he will certainely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, he will never be ſtained in his faithfulneſſe.
<note place="margin">Mal. 37.40.</note> So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.40. <hi>God will ſave his people from the wicked becauſe they truſt in him:</hi> That is, God will preſerve his owne faithfulneſſe, not any ſoule ſhall truſt on him in vaine, much leſſe be deceived by rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 48.10.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.160.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.160. <hi>Thy word is true from the beginning, and every one of thy righteous judgements endureth for ever.</hi> That is, God is true to his word from everlaſting, and his truth and righteouſneſſe abideth for ever, not any that can challenge him with unfaithfulneſſe; his robe of righteouſneſſe is ſpotleſſe; this is his glory, and ſo he values it. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> bears witneſſe to it, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.16. <hi>Seeke yet out of the book of the Lord,

               </gap>, looke into Gods word, and what ever you finde hee hath ſaid, he will make it good, not any tittle of his word ſhall faile, you ſhall never blemiſh him in his faithfulneſſe, for it is his glory.</p>
            <p>Now ſanctified Reaſon let mee aske you if this be not a good reaſon why you ſhould truſt in God, becauſe it is his glory to be faithfull, and that glory which hee hath unſpottedly preſerved from everlaſting. Fleſhly judgements ſees reaſon in this; for when they commit buſineſſe and truſt to men, they will chooſe as they thinke the moſt faithfull to the worke: and when men do otherwiſe, we count they have loſt their common reaſon, and when we chooſe men to fight our Battles, in whom we commit much truſt; Doe we not chooſe ſuch men who make it their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be gallant; and will rather chooſe to dye, then ſtaine their fidelity and their valour? Why, upon this account ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may ſafely commit all truſt to God, it is his glory to be ſaithfull: Sinne and all the other enemies of God and his people ſhall periſh in the maintaining of the glory of Gods faithfulneſſe: I am to ſeeke of all reaſon if this doe not anſwer the beſt of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to truſt that God who makes it his glory to be faithful, and that faithfulneſſe which never was ſtained.</p>
            <p>A ſixth reaſon that I ſhal offer, is this: That God is an inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted fountaine and treaſury of all grace and goodneſſe, that either the ſoules or bodies of his people can ſtand in need of, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promiſe more then he can perform, nor can any of his people want that good which is not in him; hee is not onely all good in himſelfe, but alſo the fountain of all that which fils heaven and earth: good is originall in God, and in every thing elſe, as it is derived from God, or received of God; what ever of mercy and grace, either externall or internall, it is received, and God is the fountaine.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth acknowledge God to be the fountain
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115819:45"/>and giver of all the good he enjoyed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 23. It was God that <hi>made him lye down in green paſtures, that lead him by ſtill waters, that reſtored his ſoule, and lead him in the paths of righteouſneſſe; that prepared a table before him in the middeſt of his enemies; that annoynted his head with oyle, and made his cup to run over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He found God ſo full of all good, that he filled him, till his cup run over, and that in the middeſt of his enemies, a place more apt to ſtreights then fulneſſe; yet this was <hi>Davids</hi> condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was his ſhepheard, he received from an inexhauſted fountaine, therefore his cup runs over: God is ſo full, that if he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doe but drop of his owne fulneſe, the narrow veſſel of the creature runs over, he is the fountaine of life, and the God of ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68, 19, 20. <hi>He daily loadeth his people with benefits, for he is the God of ſalvation.</hi> The ſull fountaine of all bleſſings, there is fulneſs of grace in him to kil ſinne, and to ſave the ſinner; there is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of love in him to pardon the greateſt evill, and to love the leaſt good in his children; there is fulneſſe of power in him to cruſh and deſtroy a world of Enemies, and to preſerve his owne little Flocke; there is riches of goodneſſe and mercy in him to ſupply all the wants of his people: In a word there is all good in God that wee can either aske or need; to read his Attributes, will diſcover his fulneſſe. And now me-thinkes ſanctified Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould anſwer as <hi>Simon-Peter</hi> did our Saviour in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> verſe 68. When Chriſt asked his Diſciples if they would leave him alſo, his anſwer is, <hi>Lord to whom ſhall wee goe, thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi> So ſhould Saints fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſanctified Reaſon ſay to GOD, thou art an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted fountaine of grace and goodneſſee, wee can go no whither but to thee for Eternall life, for thou art to thy people the fountain of life; That is, life from all Eternity. To my underſtanding this ſhould bee a prevailing argument, with the pureſt and righteſt reaſon to caſt all upon him that is all, and to truſt in the fountaine of life, for life, that can give moſt which is moſt, and nothing can give all, but GOD that is all in himſelfe. Eternity cannot waſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nor conſume the leaſt of GODS fulneſſe, therefore is GOD a ſuitable fulneſſe for Eternall ſoules, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reſted upon that can never fail to be what our ſouls ſtand in need of to all eternity: Reaſon carries men from one thing to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115819:46"/>another, becauſe they conceive a greater good in the laſt then in the firſt, how ſhould it teach men then to goe from all to God, becauſe in him is all good, and to reſt in nothing but in him, becauſe there is good in nothing out of him, and for over to depend on him; becauſe he is not onely good, but the fountaine of all good.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh and laſt argument that I ſhall give to ſanctified Reaſon, is this: That what ever any ſoule beleeveth and truſteth in beſides God, it muſt and will deceive the ſoule, there is no rock of ages beſides him, nor is there any Almighty power ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the 46. <hi>Iſay</hi> beginning, there the Prophet ſhewes how the Idols of Babylon could not ſave themſelves, but they and them which truſted in them, were led into captivity together: I ſhall offer but one Scripture more to this truth, and that is in the 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord, for he ſhall be like the Heath in the deſart, and ſhall not ſee when God commeth:</hi> Here we ſee is the curſe of God upon truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in fleſh which is onely proper to God; this is his glory which he will not give to another, and the curſe of God will ſoone blaſt all fleſh that is but graſſe; ſo that it ſhall prove vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deceive all that truſt in it; thus I hope the truth of the argument appeares by Scripture, and ſure I am, the experience that every ſoul hath had of the vanity of all things beſides God, doth add much teſtimony to this truth; and if thus, give me leave to aske ſanctified Reaſon, if it can juſtifie it ſelfe to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in chooſing vanity to put truſt in, and laying the weight of eternity upon that which hath not a moment of its owne, or a dram of ſufficiency to anſwer that weight; if not, then to this ſanctified Reaſon I dare affirme, that God is the onely object for a ſoules belleſe, and that there is no other eternall and ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build upon; and this is the maine ſcope that I have in all the arguments, to hold this forth to ſanctified Reaſon, that

            <p>In the next place I ſhall offer by a few particulers, in ſome meaſure a diſcovery of the evill of unbeliefe, of not truſting of God, and in God, of not truſting all upon God, and making him our all in all; and this diſcovery hath one and the ſame end with the former arguments.</p>
            <p>The firſt evill which I ſhall hold forth of unbeliefe, is this:</p>
            <p>That it doth as much as in us lyeth, make God a lyer: For proofe, conſider that full Scripture to this purpoſe, in the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that beleeveth not God, maketh him a lyer, becauſe hee beleeveth not the Record that God giveth of his Sonne:</hi> This Scripture holds forth plainely this, that not to beleeve the Record of God, is to ſay in the unbeleife of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earts, that God is a lyer, truly unbeliefe can ſpeake no other language, nor give no better title to God, for not beleeving the Record of God, is a denyall of the truth of that Record, and ſo conſequently the truth of God; for the Record of God cannot bee falſe ſo long as God is true, and that unbeliefe which ſayes the Record of God is not true, doth in the ſame breath ſay, that God is not true; now not to beleeve the Record of God, is to ſay it is not true, for this carryes the ſtrength and baſſes of all reaſon along with it, to beleeve that which we judge to be true, and to deny beliefe where we judge untruth: The old Serpent the Devill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in Paradiſe with this temptation, to perſwade our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that what God had ſaid was not true, that they might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115819:47"/>eate of the forbidden fruite, that death was not in the act, as God had ſaid, <hi>But the knowledge of good and evill;</hi> It was unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of God in their hearts that made them call God the lyer, and what the Serpent ſaid to be truth; therefore choſe to eate, not beleeving they had eate to death, as God told them, and ſo in their hearts making God a lyer; this is properly the fruit of unbeliefe, to count Gods record untrue, and ſo to act contrary to the recorded and revealed truths of God: This is a horred evill, that which Saints in truth cannot but tremble to thinke of, to put the lye upon God, reproach upon his perfection, to trample his truthes under our feet as untruthes, and to queſtion the righteouſneſſe of the ever righteous God; this is the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of all evill, the onely ſafe and retyring place for Satan, he reignes no where ſo ſecurely as in the unbeleeving heart, where God is made a lyer, that darkneſſe makes the Devill to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as truth, ſo that there his lawes prevaile, and he reignes as ſupreame.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Second evill of unbeliefe.</note> Unbeliefe makes men to deny and forſake their faireſt profeſſions of Chriſt and holineſſe, rather then to ſuffer for them; and this is the true reaſon why ſo many Profeſſours of Chriſt and holineſſe in times of proſperity and publike owning of godlineſſe, doe forſake both Chriſt and holineſſe in times of ſuffering for God and his wayes, becauſe theſe withering bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were onely in Chriſt by profeſſion, not by faith; theſe profeſs Chriſt for the gaine of an outward reputation, but do not live in Chriſt by faith, and in times of ſuffering, the beauty of Chriſt is loſt to ſuch an eye; and for want of an eye of faith by which the fulneſſe, glory and excellency of Chriſt is diſcerned, theſe unbeleeving profeſſors, deny their profeſſion, and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter too, if it comes to ſuffering with Chriſt, if on him, they will ſweare with <hi>Peter,</hi> they never knew him, and though they ſweare yet they doe not lye; for ſuch as leave their profeſſion of Chriſt and holineſſe through unbeliefe, and become unholy, they may truely ſay they never knew him, for whom ever truly knows Chriſt in the ſpirit will never leave him; an eye of faith ſees ſo much beauty, faithfulneſſe, power, grace, and goodneſſe in God and Chriſt, that though ſufferings comes as waves of the Sea, yet will not leave God and Chriſt, but cleave cloſer to him, beleeving in his grace and goodneſſe for ſupport and deliverance,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115819:48"/>but that ſoule which beleeves not in God, and doth not by an eye of faith ſee fulneſſe in him of power, grace, and goodneſſe, to ſupport and deliver, will never truſt in him; but with <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> imbrace the preſent World; ſuch as follow Chriſt onely for the Loaves, will leave him at the appearance of his Croſſe: That forward Profeſſor in the 18. <hi>of Luke</hi> 18. ſo on, which juſtified himſelfe in keeping all the Commandements from his youth, yet could not part with his worldly riches and make Chriſt his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much leſſe take up ſufferings, becauſe of unbeliefe; he would leave his good Maſter, as he called Chriſt, rather then his goods, which were indeed his Maſter through the unbeliefe of his heart, all his faire profeſſion and offers after Chriſt, comes to nothing, becauſe of unbeliefe; this Chriſt knew, therefore makes diſcovery of the man by trying his faith, or by manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his unbeliefe; it is the beleeving ſoule that followes the Lamb whereſoever he goes, it is onely faith by which the ſoule is able to take up the Croſſe of Chriſt and follow him, but unbeliefe leaveth Chriſt and his Croſſe together, though it have profeſſed not to leave Chriſt though it ſhould dye with him; yet in the appearance of ſuch a tryall the unbeleever denies his profeſſion to ſave his outſide from ſuffering; this is the conſtant aſſociate of unbeliefe; and therefore God is pleaſed in his wiſedome to let ſufferings be the attendance to the profeſſion of his name in truth, that thereby he might diſcover even to the World, the precious from the vile, who live in him by faith, and whom onely by profeſſion; thus doth God diſcover the evill of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, of which argument this preſent age hath not been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>A third evill of unbeliefe,
<note place="margin">Third evill of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>tch, <hi>King Nebuchadnezzar, in the</hi> 3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 15. <hi>Who is that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115819:48"/>God that ſhall deliver you out of my hands:</hi> As if he had ſaid, is there any God hath power greater then I, is there any God or any power in God, that can deliver out of my hands; when I have heat the Furance ſeven times hotter then before, what power can preſerve you from the fire of my fury, and my Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</p>
            <p>We may finde unbeliefe in <hi>Sarah</hi> putting this very queſtion, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Therefore Sarah laughed within her ſelfe, ſaying, After I am waxed old ſhall I have pleaſure, my Lord being old alſo:</hi> If we obſerve the Scripture it amounts to this, What now I and my Lord am old, now all hopes in nature is gone, can God now make good his word to me in giving me a Childe, now we are both old; this is the true queſtion that unbelief makes, can God doe this great thing? Shee laughed in way of ſleighting the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, through unbeliefe, concerning the power which ſhould effect it: So when <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet did Propheſie of that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and great plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi> when they were at that time ſtrongly beſieged and in great wants, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.1, 2. the Text ſayes, <hi>That a Lord on whoſe hands the King leaned, anſwered the man of God and ſayd, Behold if the Lord would make windowes in Heaven, might this thing be;</hi> This is the proper language of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, thou talkeſt of too great things for God to doe, are not we ſtraitly beſieged, and all our proviſions gone, and doeſt thou ſpeake of ſo great a plenty in ſo ſhort a time, which way ſhould God doe this; what ſhall he make windowes in Heaven, and raine downe this plenty, it can come no other way; thus we ſee the great evill of unbeliefe, how it queſtions the power of God, and as it were ungods him, for to make his deficient, is to make him no God.</p>
            <p>A fourth evill is this; Unbeliefe is the ſeale of damnation, he that beleeveth not is condemned in himſelfe; we have a full Scripture to this purpoſe, in <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>But hee that beleeveth not is condemned already, becauſe hee hath not believed in the Name of the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> Unbeliefe it ſeales up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, becauſe it caſts off the ſalvation of Gods free grace; now that which denies the one, ſeales up the other; not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt is to put from us all poſſibility of ſalvation, and to ſeale the ſoule up to a certainty of damnation; reade the laſt verſe of that third of <hi>John, He that beleeveth on the Bon hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115819:49"/>life, and hee that beleeveth not the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth in him:</hi> Whom ever beleeveth not in Chriſt, the ſalvation of God, ſhall never ſee life, ſhall never live in the beholding of God reconciled to him, but hath the wrath of God, the ſeale of damnation abiding on him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> As unbeliefe keeps the ſoule from God, ſo it makes the ſoule unpleaſing to God, that there is no intercourſe betweene God and an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſoule; now what can be a more viſible ſeale of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then this? Separation of the ſoule from God which unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe makes, unbeliefe biddeth defiance to God and his ſalvation, and ſo ſeales up the ſoule unto condemnation, unbeliefe is ſo truly the ſeale of damnation, that no ſinne nor ſinnes can damne any ſoule without, for where faith in Chriſt liveth, there Chriſt is the death of all ſinne, ſatisfaction for all ſinne, and the life of ſoules, though all ſinne be damnable, yet no ſinne nor ſinnes can damne without unbeliefe: <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth in him</hi> (which is Chriſt) <hi>ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Text, and you ſhall finde this in it, that nothing but unbeliefe can hinder the ſoule of eternall life; <hi>for whoſoever,</hi> the greateſt and vileſt of ſinners, that ſhall beleeve in Chriſt, ſhall certainely be ſaved; whoſoever ſinnes and beleeves not in Chriſt hath damnation in every ſinne, and his unbeliefe is the ſeale of his damnation, but whoſoever beleeveth in Chriſt, though the greateſt of ſinners, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life; damnation is ſealed in unbeliefe, and unbeliefe ſeales up dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; the Devill delights in all ſinne, but he lives in no ſinne ſo contented and ſecure, as in unbeliefe; it is the great ſeale of his Kingdome, that which holds faſt all his intereſt in the ſoule, unbeliefe it maintaines the Devils intereſt moſt of all ſinnes in the ſoule, therefore his indeavour moſt of all is to maintaine unbeliefe in the ſoule; it was want of faith in the Apoſtles when at they could not caſt out Devils; Satan is never depoſed of his intereſt in any ſoule or body but by faith; if he maintaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe he maintaines his intereſt, the ſeale of his Kingdome of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>A fifth evill of unbeliefe is this, It makes men vile in ſecret, though openly they make a profeſſion of godlineſſe, he that profeſſeth holineſſe with his outſide, and indeavours onely to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115819:49"/>keep that faire which comes to the view of the World; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth ſecret opportunities to be evill, and to doe evill, muſt needs doe it from a principle of unbeliefe; for did they beleeve the al-ſeeing eye of God, and ſee God with an eye of faith, they would be more carefull of committing evill in his ſight, then in the ſight of men; an unbelieving ſoule, may upon ſome conſiderations of repute, and eſteeme with the World, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoide open ſinnes which makes open ſcandall, and ſo brings open ſhame, but for ſecret ſinnes it is ready to ſerve Satan when he pleaſeth, becauſe it ſeeth not God, nor doth indeed beleeve that God ſeeth him, and therefore Satan doth never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb nor diſcourage that outward profeſſion of holineſſe, which giveth obedience to his commands in ſecret, he is content the outſide ſhould ſeeme to be Gods, ſo that the inſide be his, his chiefe buſineſſe and endeavour is to hinder true faith in the ſoul, he cares not, let profeſſion be at what height it will, if he can but keep a foot unbeliefe in the ſoule, he knowes in ſecret that ſoule will obey him what ever profeſſion it makes of God and godlineſſe to the World; the Devill loves to be in Gods room in the heart, and if he can but by unbeliefe maintaine his intereſt there, he hath his ends; and a profeſſion of holineſſe in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, makes the ſoule ſeven times more his, then before; and this advantage he makes to himſelfe and his Kingdome, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbeliefe alive in the heart, for thereby he keeps the heart intire to himſelfe, and can make ſuch a ſoule ſinne in ſecret at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Men will through unbeliefe be falſe to their vowes, promiſes, and ingagements, both to God and his people; when as their corrupted reaſon telleth them that they may be gainers by it, or their carnall hearts conceive a neceſſity of it: Such as live not truely on God by faith, they never ingage to God or his people but for their owne ends; it is ſelfe-love that inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them, they neither love nor would they truſt either God or his people, could they effect their owne ends, but many times God caſteth them into ſuch ſtreights, that their fleſhly reaſon tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them there is no way out, but by the aſſiſtance of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; at ſuch a time theſe unbelieving hearts will not ſtick at the making of any vow to God, or promiſes to his people; but if once they come as it were to ſee ſhoare againe, or but to have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115819:50"/>one foote upon the Land that the danger and bitterneſſe of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th is over, then they thinke there is no ſuch need of the aſſiſtance either of God or his people, and then all former vowes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are forgotten: and it may be in this very nicke of time fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers preſſe upon them to be faithleſſe to God and his people, declaring themſelves to be enemies to all that ſhall be friends to God and his people: Now the unbelieving ſoule calls this a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to him of being falſe to God and his people, in all its former vowes and promiſes; ſuch ſoules will argue thus, what ſhould we doe? the multitude call vpon us, and are reſtleſſe with us, ſo that they will give us no reſt till we ſatisfie them in that which makes us falſe to God and man in our former vowes and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. If we were not ſo preſſed, we ſhould not doe as we doe; we ſhould in ſome meaſure make good what wee have formerly ſaid.</p>
            <p>This anſwer is made upon a miſtake: It is not the preſſing of the multitude, but the unbeliefe of the heart that makes ſuch prove falſe in their engagements and promiſes to God and his people; were there faith to truſt God, that would keep the ſoul cloſe to God; believing ſoules make God their refuge in all ſtreights, and counteth nothing to be ſo great an evill as to be falſe to God, or to diſtruſt his faithfulneſſe: but unbelieving ſouls they owne, and deny God, they promiſe, and prove falſe to God, as their fleſhly reaſon preſents God to them, and their owne advantage in what they doe; this pretending to truth and reality in falſeneſſe, is the naturall proceed of unbeliefe in the heart.
<note place="margin">Gen. 40.23.</note> We may read a diſcovery of this in <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.23. The chiefe <hi>Butler</hi> forgot both <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his promiſes to him in the priſon, when as himſelfe was in thoſe enjoyments that his heart thirſted after; when ſoules live upon God by faith, ſuch faith maketh them faithfull to God and his people; but where ſelfe is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt life, there it is the higheſt end: and thus it is with unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoules, they prize nothing above ſelfe, therefore can be falſe to all, when as their fleſhly reaſon telleth them, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may preſerve and advance ſelfe. This is another great and certain evill of unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Unbeliefe it damps the glory of God, and leſſens the grace of God to the ſoule: A diſtruſt of the truth and reality of any thing takes away from ſuch an eye all the beauty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115819:50"/>of it, ſo puts a damp both upon the beauty of the thing, and the affection of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>If a man be ſhewed a rich Diamond, and he believeth it to be but ſome piece of glaſſe, or at beſt but a cryſtall; this his beliefe doth to himſelfe much take off the beauty and value of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, ſo that the affections are little or nothing anſwerable to the eſteeme, and this ariſeth from his unbeliefe: So is it with the unbelieving ſoule, ſay what you can of the riches, the glory, and excellency of Gods free grace, of Jeſus Chriſt, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his grace; yet he believeth not any thing; If this unbelieving ſoule ſhould heare the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſay, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt her Beloved is fairer and fuller of beauty then all the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veds in the world.</hi> Hee would not believe, but thinke that the world is a more beautifull Beloved then Jeſus Chriſt, and upon this conſideration, unbelievers chooſe the world for their Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as by faith ſoules cloſe with, and center in Chriſt: ſo by unbeliefe ſoules leave Chriſt to embrace this preſent evill World. The reaſon is this; faith ſees the beauty, and believes the reality of Chriſt, and the free grace of God, ſo reſts and centers there: but unbeliefe that ſayes there is no ſuch grace in God, nor any ſuch riches of glory in grace, no ſuch beauty in Chriſt, nor ſuch neceſſity of being ſaved onely through his blood, and therefore reſts and centers their eternall ſoules in ſomething below God and Chriſt; this is another true property and perfect evill of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belife in the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Another evill of unbeliefe in the ſoule, is this; It makes men inordinate in their purſuites after the World, and ſo likewiſe in their ſorrow upon their diſappointments or loſſes of the World; it makes men ſeeke their heaven here, and looke upon nothing in God as enough to repaire the loſſe of the World: An unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoule cannot live upon God day by day for its daily bread; if the barns be not full, it believeth it ſhall ſtarve; the fulneſſe of God cannot ſatisfie it; If the heart be empty of faith, the hand muſt be full of the World, or there will be no quiet in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and therefore unbelieving ſoules will in their inordinate purſuite after the World, venture ſoule and all upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of unbeliefe; men create their owne happineſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhape their owne felicity in their owne braines, and purſue their owne fancies with a violent zeale of ſpirit. Now if
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115819:51"/>God diſappoint them, if hee cracke their foundation, throw downe that building which they have raiſed in their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as a habitation for themſelves to reſt in, then they are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate in their griefe, as they were before in their purſuite, and both theſe the fruit of unbeliefe; unbeliefe makes them ſeek felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of God, and the ſame frame of ſpirit makes them to be as men without hope, when as the world proves empty, though God be everlaſting fulneſſe: Unbelieving ſoules have no eye to ſee that more exceeding and eternall weight of glory which is in God, in Chriſt, in heaven for Saints, and therefore they ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſue a dying glory, and are ſuch liveleſſe, hopeleſſe, undone ſoules when that ſailes them; If there be no heaven in the world, ſuch ſoules thinks there is no heaven at all; if their owne heaven faile them, then there is not heaven enough in God to ſatisfie them. It is worthy the obſerving, how unbeliefe in <hi>Job</hi> did make him break out into paſſion upon this very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Job</hi> 3. <hi>beg. Job</hi> 6.8. How he quarrels with the day of his birth, and makes it his <hi>requeſt</hi> to God that he would <hi>cut him off:</hi> What is the matter with <hi>Job</hi> now? this language had not hee heard to fall from his lips formerly? why now <hi>Job</hi> is ſtripped of the worlds riches, hee would be cut off from the world; if the comforts of the world dyes, then he would have no longer being in the world: If it be thus with <hi>Job</hi> when the ſunne of unbeliefe which is dying in him doth but appeare, how is it then with thoſe that live in unbeliefe, and have no acquaintance with God at all, their diſappointments is their hell; and they ſay of God as thoſe evill ſpirits did of Chriſt, <hi>That he is come to torment them before their time.</hi> Thus we ſee that unbeliefe is ſo potent an evill in the ſoule, that it unjoynts the whole frame of the ſoule, leaves it ſo looſe, that every blaſt ſhakes it, and overturnes all the joyes and comforts of it; that which is not fixed in God, is apt to change with all that is changeable, and living only in changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vanity, is alwayes in a troubled ſea, where it can finde no place to caſt the anchor of hope on, becauſe it ſees not God: This is another certain evill of unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>The laſt evill which I ſhall mention of unbeliefe, is this; It is a ſinne which hath all other ſinnes in it, and keepes the ſoul in a readineſſe to anſwer all the temptations of Satan with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It was unbeliefe that made the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115819:51"/>againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to doubt of Gods making good his word to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10, 11. <hi>And they ſaid unto</hi> Moſes,

<note place="margin">1 Chron. 21. beg.</note> but ſo far as unbeliefe lives in the ſoule. Had not the Devill found unbeliefe in <hi>David,</hi> he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevailed with him to number the People; when his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt the ſtrength of God, then was a time for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to tempt him to try his owne, therefore ſayes he, <hi>number the people:</hi> Know how ſtrong the arme of fleſh is, that thou maiſt have ſomething to truſt too; this is as true a touch-ſtone of unbeliefe in the heart as any liveth; when the ſoule by faith ſees enough in God, it is not ſolicitous to have an account of the fulneſſe of fleſh: but diſtruſt in the former, puts the ſoule upon enquiry after the latter for ſatisfaction, and thus unbeliefe keeps open houſe for Satan at all times; it is the chiefe engine by which he upholds his kingdome and his credite; no ſinne ſo neare and deare to him as this, it is his ſecond ſelfe, where ever it beares ſway, it maintaines his lawes, and his Image. See an emminent example of this in <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27.
<note place="margin">Matth. 27.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Who when he had betrayed his Maſter, went and hanged himſelfe.</hi> Satan by his Engine of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe drew him through the one ſin to the other, he did not believe in Chriſt, therefore he betrayed him; nor did he believe there was grace enough in God to pardon the worſt of ſinners, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hangs himſelfe. So the Devill firſt perſwaded <hi>Eve</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.4, 5.</note> 5.

This is the ſtrongeſt hold of Satan in any ſoule; and if once that ſtronger man, the Lord
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115819:52"/>Jeſus Chriſt caſt him out of this hold, hee loſes his whole late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in, and command over the ſoule; but ſo long as he can keep this Garriſon, the ſoule ſhall ſurely be kept in a warfare againſt Chriſt. Want of faith in God muſt needs make want of love, ſervice, child-like fear, and obedience, and where theſe are not, all manner of evill muſt needs be. I hope by theſe particulers I have given ſome little light into this Kingdome of darkneſſe: it is a large field, the dimenſions of it can be taken by no hand, but ſuch an one as can compaſſe the whole earth, and all the but it; for all the evill of the world will come within this circle of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe. I intend here no farther a travell upon this diſcovery then I have gone; to a ſpirituall heart I am ſure every one of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers will appeare to be very great evils, then the fountaine of them muſt needs be exceedingly great in evil; All I aim tis this, that as unbeliefe is the greateſt evill in, and the greateſt enemie to the ſoule, ſo that the Readers would thus looke upon unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and as ſoules fore-warned, to be fore-armed. Secret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are the worſt of enemies; I have therefore pointed at this great enemy that it might not be greater then it is in it ſelfe, by its ſecret lurking undiſcovered in the ſoule.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the next place in ſome particulers as before, hold forth the benefits of faith in God, in Chriſt, and his word, in the ſoules of believers.</p>

Burthened hearts doe uſe to ſeeke ſome true friendly boſome to open themſelves to, and ſo in ſome meaſure to eaſe themſelves; now in this, faith is a mighty advantage to the ſoule, for it leads the ſoule to God, and God its Father, where it ſhall not only open, but certainly eaſe it ſelfe of all its burthens. <hi>Come unto mee all yee that are weary and heavy loaden</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>and I will refreſh you.</hi> I, ſayes faith in the ſoule, goe to your Father, he will eaſe you of all burthens, and reſt you in his owne boſome; when as the ſoule ſees the power of a God, and the love of a Father centre in one object, it is eaſily drawn to runne after it in all its wants. Now thus faith holds forth God to the ſoule, as God our Father, and by faith believing ſouls goes to God in all their wants, and cry out, O our Father, we want victory over ſin in our converſations, deliverance from the temptations of Satan, to be carryed in thy Spirit above the love and joy of the world, to have our wils wholly melted into thine, to be ſpirituall in our light, motion, and worſhip; We deſire as our head did for us, to be kept from the evill of the world, and that thou wouldſt provide for us all things needfull quite through the Wilderneſſe; theſe are our wants and deſires.</p>
